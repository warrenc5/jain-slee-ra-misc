2.1   UssdBind
UssdBind is used for the USSD service application to log in to the USSDC, to go through authentication, and to establish a network connection. Prior to a USSD session, the USSD service application must perform a Bind operation, requesting to log in to the USSDC. During login, the account name and login password of the USSD service application must be provided. Whether the USSD service application passes the authentication, the USSDC sends a response message UssdBindResp to the USSD service application.
UssBind can be sent only by the USSD service application to the USSDC; UssdBindResp can be sent only by the USSDC to the USSD service application.

UssdShake is used for handshaking between the USSD service application and the USSDC. Upon receipt of a UssdShake message from the USSD service application, the USSDC sends a response message UssdShakeResp. The USSD service application periodically (at an interval of a maximum of five seconds) sends a UssdShake message to the USSDC, and checks whether a UssdShakeResp message is received to determine whether the session between the USSD service application and the USSDC is functioning. To determine whether its session with the USSD service application is functioning, the USSDC checks whether it has received a UssShake message.

3.2.6   UssdOpType
The UssdOpType field indicates the operation types of a USSD session. There are four operation types: Request, Notify, Response, and Release. In different types of sessions, the values of this field follow these regulations: 
1.	UssdBegin corresponds to two operation types: Request and Notify. The operation type of the UssdBegin session initiated by a mobile station can be Request only. The operation type of the UssdBegin session initiated by the service party can be Request or Notify.
2.	UssdContinue corresponds to three operation types: Request, Notify, and Response. The operation type of the UssdContinue session initiated by a mobile station can be Response only. The operation type of the UssdContinue session initiated by the service party can be Request or Notify.
3.	UssdEnd corresponds to two types: Request and Release. If the sender of a session is a mobile station, the operation type of UssdEnd can be Response only. If the sender of the session is the service party, the operation type of UssdEnd can be Release only.
The following table lists the values of the operation types of the UssdOpType field:

3.2.7   MsIsdn
The MsIsdn field indicates the number of the mobile station in a session.
3.2.8   ServiceCode
The ServiceCode field indicates the service code of a USSD session. This field is not used in UssdBegin sessions initiated by mobile stations, but is used only in UssdBegin sessions initiated by the service party. In UssdSwitch, this field indicates the target service code to switch a session to. For the value range of the service code, refer to the GSM02.90 protocol.
Note: This field is not used now because this field length is only 4 characters, but the real length of s service code usually exceeds 4 characters.If the session iniated by MS, the service code should be parsed from the field UssdString.
3.2.9   CodeScheme
The CodeScheme field indicates the coding scheme of a USSD string. For the detailed coding scheme, refer to GSM03.38.To a session initiated by the USSD service party, this field indicates what scheme the USSDC uses to code a USSD string. To a session initiated by the USSDC to the USSD service application, this fielsd can be ignored. The USSDC communicates with the USSD service application using plain codes. Common coding schemes include:
0x0F (seven-digit code), 0x48 (sixteen-digit code), and 0x44 (eight-digit code).
3.2.10   UssdString
The UssdString field indicates an information string of a USSD session. In a USSDBegin session message initiated by a mobile station, the format of UssdString is: Preample+SC+*+SI+#, where the preamble consists of any combination of 1 to 3 digits of * and #, SC is the service code, SI is a service information string, * is a separator, and # is the terminator. In other session messages, UssdString can contain any content. 
If CodeScheme designates the seven-digit coding scheme, the maximum length of UssdString is 182 characters. If CodeScheme designates the eight-digit coding scheme, the maximum length of UssdString is 160 characters. If CodeScheme designates the sixteen-digit coding scheme, the maximum length of UssdString is 80 characters (160 bytes).
If the network side initiates the session UssdBegin, the format of UssdString is:@ + service code + @ + specific USSD parameter information. If UssdString is not in the aforementioned format, the service code must be entered in ServiceCode.
In case of a service switching message UssdSwitch, the format of UssdString is:@ + service code + @ + specific USSD parameter information. If UssdString is not in the aforementioned format, the target service code to switch to must be entered in ServiceCode.
3.2.11   SwitchMode
The SwitchMode field indicates the modes of service switching. It comprises two switching modes:0: global switching and 1: local switching. Global switching means that the service switching is implemented by the USSD central office where the service application resides. Local switching means that the service switching is implemented by the service platform (or the USSDC) directly connecting the service application.
3.2.12   ChargeRatio
The ChargeRatio field indicates the charging ratio of the charging indication. Its unit is fen (0.01 yuan). The value 0 means free of charge. 
3.2.13   ChargeType
The ChargeType field indicates the charging types of the charging indication. Currently, this field includes the following charging types:0: free, 1: per message, 2: per monthly flat rate, and 3: per monthly flat rate for downlink.
3.2.14   ChargeSource
The ChargeSource field indicates the identifier of the charging source. The service party interprets the specific implication of the contents of this field. 
3.2.15   ChargeLocation
The ChargeLocation field indicates the location where bills are generated. There are the following three cases: 1: Both the USSDC and the USSD service platform generate bills. 2: Only the USSDC generates bills. 3: Only the USSD service platform generates bills.
