   Description:

      This package defines signals to generate audio tones.  This
      package does not specify parameter values.  It is intended to be
      extendable.  Generally, tones are defined as an individual signal
      with a parameter, ind, representing "interdigit" time delay, and a
      tone id to be used with playtones.  A tone id should be kept
      consistent with any tone generation for the same tone.  MGs are
      expected to be provisioned with the characteristics of appropriate
      tones for the country in which the MG is located.

   Designed to be extended only.

E.3.1 Properties

   None.

E.3.2 Events

   None.

E.3.3 Signals

   Play tone
   SignalID: pt (0x0001)

         ParameterID: tl (0x0001)

            Type: list of tone ids

            List of tones to be played in sequence.  The list SHALL

         Inter signal duration
         ParameterID: ind (0x0002)

            Type: integer

            Timeout between two consecutive tones in milliseconds

   package can add possible values for tone id as well as adding
   individual tone signals.

E.3.4 Statistics

E.4   Tone Detection Package

   PackageID: tonedet (0x0004)
   Version: 1
   Extends: None

   This Package defines events for audio tone detection.  Tones are
   selected by name (tone id).  MGs are expected to be provisioned with
   the characteristics of appropriate tones for the country in which the
   MG is located.

   Designed to be extended only:
      This package does not specify parameter values.  It is intended to
      be extendable.

E.4.1 Properties

   None.

E.4.2 Events

E.5   Basic DTMF Generator Package

   PackageID: dg (0x0005)

   allowed values of parameter tl of playtone in tonegen.

E.5.1 Properties

   None.

E.5.2 Events

   None.

E.5.3 Signals

   DTMF character 0
   SignalID: d0 (0x0010)

      Generate DTMF 0 tone.  The physical characteristic of DTMF 0 is
      defined in the gateway.

      Signal Type: Brief

      Duration: Provisioned

      Additional parameters:

         None.

   Additional values:

      d0 (0x0010) is defined as a tone id for playtone

   The other DTMF characters are specified in exactly the same way.  A
   table with all signal names and signal IDs is included.  Note that
   each DTMF character is defined as both a signal and a tone id, thus
   extending the basic tone generation package.  Also note that DTMF
   SignalIds are different from the names used in a digit map.

E.6.5 Procedures

   Digit map processing is activated only if an events descriptor is
   activated that contains a digit map completion event as defined in
   Section E.6.2 and that digit map completion event contains an eventDM
   field in the requested actions as defined in Section 7.1.9.  Other
   parameters such as KeepActive or embedded events of signals
   descriptors may also be present in the events descriptor and do not
   affect the activation of digit map processing.

   This package defines events and signals for an analog line.

   E.9.1 Properties

   None.

E.9.2 Events

   onhook
   EventID: on (0x0004)

      Detects handset going on hook.  Whenever an events descriptor is
      activated that requests monitoring for an on-hook event and the
      line is already on-hook, then the MG shall behave according to the
      setting of the "strict" parameter.

      EventDescriptor parameters:

         Strict Transition
         ParameterID: strict (0x0001)

            Type: enumeration

            Possible values: "exact" (0x00), "state" (0x01), "failWrong"
            (0x02)

              "exact" means that only an actual hook state transition to
              on-hook is to be recognized;

              "state" means that the event is to be recognized either if
              the hook state transition is detected or if the hook state
              is already on-hook;

              "failWrong" means that if the hook state is already
              on-hook, the command fails and an error is reported.

      ObservedEventsDescriptor parameters:

         Initial State
         ParameterID: init (0x0002)

            Type: Boolean

RFC 3525                Gateway Control Protocol               June 2003


            Possible values:

               "True" means that the event was reported because the line
               was already on-hook when the events descriptor containing
               this event was activated;

               "False" means that the event represents an actual state
               transition to on-hook.

   offhook
   EventID: of (0x0005)

      Detects handset going off hook.  Whenever an events descriptor is
      activated that requests monitoring for an off-hook event and the
      line is already off-hook, then the MG shall behave according to
      the setting of the "strict" parameter.

      EventDescriptor parameters:

         Strict Transition
         ParameterID: strict (0x0001)

            Type: enumeration

            Possible values: "exact" (0x00), "state" (0x01), "failWrong"
            (0x02)

               "exact" means that only an actual hook state transition
               to off-hook is to be recognized;

               "state" means that the event is to be recognized either
               if the hook state transition is detected or if the hook
               state is already off-hook;

               "failWrong" means that if the hook state is already off-
               hook, the command fails and an error is reported.

            Possible values:

               was already off-hook when the events descriptor
               containing this event was activated;

               "False" means that the event represents an actual state
               transition to off-hook.

   flashhook
   EventID: fl, 0x0006

      Detects handset flash.  A flash occurs when an onhook is followed
      by an offhook between a minimum and maximum duration.

         Minimum duration
         ParameterID: mindur (0x0004)

            may ignore cadence values they are incapable of generating.

         Frequency
         ParameterID: freq (0x0007)

            Type: integer in Hz

            Default is fixed or provisioned.  Restricted function MGs
            may ignore frequency values they are incapable of

E.9.5 Procedures

   If the MGC sets an EventsDescriptor containing a hook state
   transition event (on-hook or off-hook) with the "strict" (0x0001)
   parameter set to "failWrong", and the hook state is already what the
   transition implies, the execution of the command containing that
   EventsDescriptor fails.  The MG SHALL include error code 540
   "Unexpected initial hook state" in its reponse.

E.10.5   Procedures

   When a MGC wants to initiate a continuity test, it sends a command to
   the MG containing:

   -  a signals descriptor with the ct signal; and

   -  an events descriptor containing the cmp event.

   Upon reception of a command containing the ct signal and cmp event,
   the MG initiates the continuity test tone for the specified
   Termination.  If the return tone is detected and any other required
   conditions are satisfied before the signal times out, the cmp event
   shall be generated with the value of the result parameter equal to
   success.  In all other cases, the cmp event shall be generated with
   the value of the result parameter equal to failure.

   When a MGC wants the MG to respond to a continuity test, it sends a
   command to the MG containing a signals descriptor with the rsp
   signal.  Upon reception of a command with the rsp signal, the MG
   either applies a loopback or (for 2-wire circuits) awaits reception
   of a continuity test tone.  In the loopback case, any incoming
   information shall be reflected back as outgoing information.  In the
   2-wire case, any time the appropriate test tone is received, the
   appropriate response tone should be sent.  The MGC determines when to
   remove the rsp signal.

   When a continuity test is performed on a Termination, no echo devices
   or codecs shall be active on that Termination.

   Performing voice path assurance as part of continuity testing is
   provisioned by bilateral agreement between network operators.

         Gain control, or usage of of signal level adaptation and
         noise level reduction is used to adapt the level of the signal.
         However, it is necessary, for example for modem calls, to turn
         off this function.

         Type: integer

         Possible values:

         The gain control parameter may either be specified as
         "automatic" (0xffffffff), or as an explicit number of decibels
         of gain (any other integer value).  The default is provisioned
         in the MG.
