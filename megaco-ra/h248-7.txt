             Gateway control protocol: Generic announcement package




Summary
This Recommendation defines a generic announcement package for use with the H.248.1 Gateway
Control Protocol. The generic announcement package provides a media gateway controller with the
ability to control announcements in a media gateway. Control is provided by the definition of
announcement events (for example, "announcement completed") and announcement signals (for
example, "play a specified announcement"). As defined in ITU-T Rec. H.248.1, a "package" is an
extension to H.248.1 that supports specific behaviour.
NOTE – This Recommendation has been renumbered. It was previously known as ITU-T Rec. H.248,
Annex K.

ITU-T Recommendation H.248.7 was prepared by ITU-T Study Group 16 (2001-2004) and
approved under the WTSA Resolution 1 procedure on 17 November 2000.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of
telecommunications. The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of
ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations
on them with a view to standardizing telecommunications on a worldwide basis.
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years,
establishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these
topics.
The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are
prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.




                                                  NOTE
In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a
telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.




                                 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may
involve the use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence,
validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others
outside of the Recommendation development process.
As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had not received notice of intellectual property,
protected by patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementors are
cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the
TSB patent database.

             Gateway control protocol: Generic announcement package

1       Scope
This Recommendation defines a package that extends the applicability of the H.248.1 Gateway
Control Protocol Recommendation. Specifically, this Recommendation defines a generic
announcement package for use with the H.248.1 Gateway Control Protocol. The generic
announcement package provides a media gateway controller with the ability to control
announcements in a media gateway. Control is provided by the definition of announcement events
(for example, "announcement completed") and announcement signals (for example, "play a
specified announcement"). As defined in ITU-T Rec. H.248.1, a "package" is an extension to
H.248.1 that supports specific behaviour.

None.

4.5     Procedures
For each announcement, a default duration and number of cycles is defined in the MG. An MG
receiving such a signal plays the indicated announcement (indicated by the name parameter) for the
duration specified by the noc parameter or the signal duration. The one that expires first will stop
the announcement. If noc parameter and/or duration is not included, the MG uses the corresponding
announcements defaults.
If the signal duration is 0, the announcement l is played for the time specified by the noc parameter,
or when the noc parameter is not included in the signal, the announcement is played by its cycle
default value.
To provide additional information when an announcement is to be played, the MGC sends a play
variable announcement signal to the MG. H.248.1 doesn't guarantee in-sequence processing of
transactions. To ensure sequential playing of an announcement, a transaction reply for a command
that affects the announcement signal should be received by the Media Gateway Controller before it
sends the additional variable announcement data. An MG receiving such a signal plays the indicated
announcement (indicated by the name parameter) for the duration specified by the noc parameter or
the signal duration. The one that expires first will stop the announcement. If noc parameter and/or
duration are not included, the MG uses the corresponding announcement defaults.
If the signal duration is 0, the announcement l is played for the time specified by the noc parameter,
or when the noc parameter is not included in the signal, the announcement is played by its cycle
default value.
If the "Specific parameters" parameter is included, the MG uses the "Specific parameters
interpretation" parameter to identify and interpret the particular type of information to be included
in relation to the announcement. Examples of the types of Specific parameters include a telephone
number, date, or time.
The direction parameter can be used to indicate the direction that the announcement is to be sent.
External (default) indicates that the announcement is sent from the MG to an external point. Internal
indicates that the announcement is played into the MG to the other terminations. Both indicate
internal and external behaviour.
