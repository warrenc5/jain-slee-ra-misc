                        Gateway control protocol: Dynamic Tone
                                  Definition package




Summary
This Recommendation defines a dynamic tone definition package for use with the H.248.1 Gateway
Control Protocol. The dynamic tone definition package allows flexible tone specification in a media
gateway for feedback to audio receivers. A tone can be defined by assigning properties (for example,
frequency or duration) to an existing tone (i.e., a tone defined in some other package) or a new tone.
As defined in ITU-T Rec. H.248.1, a "package" is an extension to H.248.1 that supports specific
behavior.
NOTE – This Recommendation has been renumbered. It was formerly known as ITU-T H.248
Annex J.

Recommendation H.248.6 was prepared by ITU-T Study Group 16 (2001-2004) and approved under
the WTSA Resolution 1 procedure on 17 November 2000.




                                                               ITU-T Rec. H.248.6 (11/2000)         i
                                               FOREWORD
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of
telecommunications. The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of
ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations
on them with a view to standardizing telecommunications on a worldwide basis.
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years,
establishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these
topics.
The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are
prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.




                                                  NOTE
In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a
telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.




                                 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may
involve the use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence,
validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others
outside of the Recommendation development process.
As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had received notice of intellectual property,
protected by patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementors are
cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the
TSB patent database.

                         Gateway control protocol: Dynamic Tone
                                   Definition package

1       Scope
This Recommendation defines a package that extends the applicability of the H.248.1 Gateway
Control Protocol Recommendation. Specifically, ITU-T Rec. H.248.6 defines a dynamic tone
definition package for use with the H.248.1 Gateway Control Protocol. The dynamic tone definition
package allows flexible tone specification in a media gateway for feedback to audio receivers. A
tone can be defined by assigning properties (for example, frequency or duration) to an existing tone
(i.e. a tone defined in some other package) or a new tone.

PackageName: Dynamic Tone Definition package
PackageID: dtd (0x001c)
Extends:    None
Version:    1
This package defines a mechanism to redefine existing tones and create new tones for playback. The
existing tones are the ones described in supported packages that extend the tonegen generic package.

3.1     Properties
PropertyName: Tone ID
       PropertyID:           tid (0x0001)
       Description:
           Indicates the new or existing tone to be modified or who's tone string is to be read.
       Type:                 expanding enumeration
       Possible Values:
           Existing package_id, tone id described in supported packages that extend tonegen or
           new tones to be added.
       Defined in:           TerminationState.
           If the termination is in a context, the changes to the tones apply only to the termination
           in the context. When the termination leaves the context, the changes are lost. If the
           termination is in the null context, the changes apply to the termination from then on. If
           the termination is root, the changes apply to the whole gateway.

          Characteristics:       both read and write.
PropertyName: Tone String
        PropertyID:              tst (0x0002)
        Description:             Tone description string. See procedures ,
        Type:                    String
        Possible Values:         See procedures.
        Defined in:              TerminationState.
        Characteristics:         both read and write:

3.2       Events
None

3.3       Signals
None

3.4       Statistics
None

3.5       Procedures
3.5.1     Updating Tone Definition
To modify or create a new tone:
1)     Set tid to an existing or new package_id,tone id value.
2)     Set tst to the new tone description.
If tst is null, the id is decommissioned and removed. Only newly defined tonids can be removed.
3.5.2     Reading existing tones
To read the list of tones defined:
1)      Read tid.
To read an already defined tone string:
1)      Set tid.
2)      Read tst.
Some package-defined tones may not have a tone string in the gateway. In that case the tst read will
have the value "Not Available".
3.5.3     Tone String (tst) description
The syntax for the tone definition string is recursive and uses parenthesis as a delimiter of elements.
DefToneString below is the tone string(tst):
        DefToneString = "(" DefToneElement ["*" RepeatCount ] ")" [","/"+"/"X" DefToneString]
NOTE 1 – A separator of ',' indicates that the next definition follows sequentially in time; a separator of '+'
indicates that the following tone is to be mixed with the previous tone and is simultaneous with it; a separator
of 'X' indicates that the first tone is modulated by the second tone.
NOTE 2 – All implementations must support sequential definitions (',' separator). Mixing ('+') and
modulation ('X') support are optional; however, the implementation must make a best effort and return no
error in these cases.




2           ITU-T Rec. H.248.6 (11/2000)
NOTE 3 – Recursion is limited to a maximum of 32 levels. All implementations must support at least 2 levels
of recursion.
RepeatCount = %d1-32767 / %d0
NOTE 4 – repeatcount of 0 indicates infinite repeating.
DefToneElement = ToneName ["," ToneDuration [ "," ToneAmplitude ]]
ToneName = (Package id, Tone id) / "#"FreqValue / "&"AnnouncementParameterList
Package id = 1*VCHAR; Unique package identity string or value
Tone id = 1*VCHAR; Unique tone identity string or value
FreqValue = %d0-4000; in Hertz
AnnouncementParameterList = AnnouncementID ["," SubstitutionString]
AnnouncementID = 1*VCHAR; Unique identifier for an audio announcement
SubstitutionString = """1*VCHAR"""; a string to be inserted into an announcement.
ToneDuration = %d1-32767 / %d0; in milliseconds
NOTE 5 – ToneDuration of 0 indicates infinite duration or duration defined by the Tone id.
ToneAmplitude = "-"%d32-1 / %d0; in dBm0
An example of tone definition follows.
RingingTone = ((0x0005,0x0031),((#480)+(#620)),250,-24)*0
