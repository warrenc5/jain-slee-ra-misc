    Gateway control protocol: Error code and service change reason description




Summary
ITU-T Recommendation H.248.8 defines the service change reasons that are used in the core
H.248.1 protocol. It lists the service change reason code associated with the service change reason
code name. It provides a definition of when the service change reason is to be used. It also provides
an indication of what text may be included in the service change extension to allow further
interpretation of the service change reason. Clause 5 provides these details.
This revision addresses the following aspects:
•        Addition of new error codes: 472, 473, 511, 543.
•        Expansion of Error Codes: 401, 500.
•        Clarification on the usage of error text.
NOTE − This Recommendation has been renamed. It was formerly known as Annex L to ITU-T Rec. H.248.

ITU-T Recommendation H.248.8 was approved on 29 August 2007 by ITU-T Study Group 16
(2005-2008) under the ITU-T Recommendation A.8 procedure.




                                                              ITU-T Rec. H.248.8 (08/2007)         i
                                                FOREWORD
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of
telecommunications. The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of
ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, operating and tariff questions and issuing
Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing telecommunications on a worldwide basis.
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years,
establishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on
these topics.
The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are
prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.




                                                    NOTE
In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a
telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.
Compliance with this Recommendation is voluntary. However, the Recommendation may contain certain
mandatory provisions (to ensure e.g. interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the
Recommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words "shall" or some
other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The
use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party.




                                  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may
involve the use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence,
validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others
outside of the Recommendation development process.
As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had not received notice of intellectual property,
protected by patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementers
are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the
TSB patent database at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/.

    Gateway control protocol: Error code and service change reason description

1       Scope
This Recommendation defines the error codes that are used in the core H.248.1 protocol. It lists the
error code number associated with the error code name. It then provides a definition of when the
error code is to be used and if the error code is defined in a package. It also provides an indication
of what text may be included in the error text descriptor to allow further interpretation of the error
code. Clause 4.2 provides these details. The normal actions for failed transactions and commands
apply as specified in clause 8 of [ITU-T H.248.1]. Packages may define error codes not documented
in this Recommendation. The IANA registry should be consulted for the complete list of error
codes.
Error codes marked as "not used" are historical in nature and are for informational purposes only.
These error codes should not be used.
This Recommendation also defines the service change reasons that are used in the core H.248.1
protocol. It lists the service change reason code associated with the service change reason code
name. It provides a definition of when the service change reason is to be used. It also provides an
indication of what text may be included in the service change extension to allow further
interpretation of the service change reason. Clause 5.2 provides these details.

4       Error codes

4.1     Assigning error codes
The following considerations SHALL be met to register an error code with IANA:
1)      An error number and a one-line (80 characters maximum) string are registered for each
        error.
2)      A complete description of the conditions under which the error is detected shall be included
        in a publicly available document. The description shall be sufficiently clear to differentiate
        the error from all other existing error codes.
3)      The document should be available on a public web server and should have a stable URL.



                                                               ITU-T Rec. H.248.8 (08/2007)         1
4)      Error numbers registered by recognized standards bodies shall have 3- or 4-character error
        numbers.
5)      Error numbers registered by all other organizations or individuals shall have 4-character
        error numbers.
6)      An error number shall not be redefined, nor modified except by the organization or
        individual that originally defined it, or their successors or assigns.
Parameters included in the error text shall be coded according to the principles as specified in
Annex A or B of [ITU-T H.248.1]. If more than one parameter is included they shall be included in
the order defined in this Recommendation and separated by a comma.
Error text may be included in the error descriptor, even for those error codes for which no specific
error text is defined in this Recommendation. If error text is included it should contain the
information defined in the error specification.
NOTE − The actions carried out after an error is discovered, which results in the sending of an error code
described in clause 4.2, are specified in clause 8 of [ITU-T H.248.1].

Name: Response exceeds maximum transport PDU size
Definition: The MG or MGC is unable to assemble a complete transaction response because the
number of bytes for the message would exceed the maximum protocol data unit size of the
underlying transport. The command instance in the response to that would have caused the overflow
to be treated as if it were in error, and the reminder of the transaction is not executed, even if the
command was marked "optional".
This situation will typically arise in conjunction with the use of wildcarding, which causes the
original command to be expanded into a series of similar command instances.
If the request contained a wildcarded termination ID, the MGC or MG should send later requests
with a smaller subset of termination IDs.

5.1     Assigning service change reasons
The following considerations SHALL be met to register service change reason with IANA:
1)      A one-phrase, 80-character maximum, unique reason code is registered for each reason.
2)      A complete description of the conditions under which the reason it is used is detected, shall
        be included in a publicly available document. The description shall be sufficiently clear to
        differentiate the reason from all other existing reasons.
3)      The document should be available on a public web server and should have a stable URL.
Reason text included in the ServiceChangeReason shall be coded according to the principles as
specified in Annex A or B of [ITU-T H.248.1] with a white space between the reason number and
the reason text.
